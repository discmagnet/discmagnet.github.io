      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s no crying in baseball!
If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;re incredibly sad that baseball has been halted. And not just baseball, FANTASY BASEBALL. We wait months for the draft! We finally build our teams! And now we wait&amp;hellip; indefinitely. Who knows, the 2020 season may never come. That idea of not having something to root for is scary.
Not on my watch.
Fortunately for all of us, the newest version of Out of the Park Baseball (OOTP) was released on March 20, 2020.</description>
