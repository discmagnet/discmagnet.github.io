      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s no crying in baseball!
If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;re incredibly sad that baseball has been halted. And not just baseball, FANTASY BASEBALL. We wait months for the draft! We finally build our teams! And now we wait&amp;hellip; indefinitely. Who knows, the 2020 season may never come. That idea of not having something to root for is scary.
Not on my watch.
Fortunately for all of us, the newest version of Out of the Park Baseball (OOTP) was released on March 20, 2020.</description>

      <title>The Enhanced Quality Start: A 2018 Recap</title>

First Pitch Back in July 2018, I wrote an article which introduced three new statistics that I developed to better evaluate starting pitching performance. All the important details can be found in the article (link), but here’s a quick summary of what all happened.
The Enhanced Quality Start (eQS)
The statistic that started this all. Unlike the old Quality Start where a pitcher needs to pitch at least six innings and allow no more than three earned runs, my new, “enhanced” Quality Start is awarded to a pitcher if he pitches better than league average.</description>

First Pitch I&amp;rsquo;d like to start off by asking a trivia question:
Who pitched better in 2015? Shelby Miller or Drew Hutchison?
Here&amp;rsquo;s a hint. Their records were 6-17 and 13-5, respectively.
I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that with this information you would be comfortable answering Drew Hutchison.
Here&amp;rsquo;s another hint. Their ERAs were 3.02 and 5.57, respectively. Yes, respectively. Same order.
I&amp;rsquo;m guessing now you may be reconsidering.</description>
