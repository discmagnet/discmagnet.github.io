      <description>First Pitch I&amp;rsquo;d like to start off by asking a trivia question:
Who pitched better in 2015? Shelby Miller or Drew Hutchison?
Here&amp;rsquo;s a hint. Their records were 6-17 and 13-5, respectively.
I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that with this information you would be comfortable answering Drew Hutchison.
Here&amp;rsquo;s another hint. Their ERAs were 3.02 and 5.57, respectively. Yes, respectively. Same order.
I&amp;rsquo;m guessing now you may be reconsidering.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my point.
The notion that wins are sufficient to measure starting pitcher performance would be absurd in today&amp;rsquo;s game.</description>
